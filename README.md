 ## About this project
 
 This was intended to be just something to practice html and css but I really liked the idea so probably I'll put more work into it when I have time
 
 Maybe it's an overkill but the plan is to make it on React. It doesn't have that much state but it does have a lot of elements that can be reused if they are components.
